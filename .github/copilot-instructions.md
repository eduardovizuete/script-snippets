# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Script Snippets Repository

## Repository Context
This is a collection of scripts, code snippets, AI prompts, and automation tools organized for productivity and reuse. When working in this repository:

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Comments**: Include clear header comments for all scripts explaining purpose, usage, and requirements
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- **Portability**: Write scripts that work across multiple platforms when possible
- **Documentation**: Include inline documentation for complex logic

## Script Standards
- Make bash scripts executable and include proper shebangs
- Use descriptive filenames that indicate functionality
- Include usage examples in comments
- Test scripts thoroughly before committing
- Handle edge cases and provide meaningful error messages

## File Organization
- Place files in appropriate category directories
- Update README files when adding new categories
- Use consistent naming conventions within each category
- Include requirements and dependencies in script headers

## AI Prompt Guidelines
- Create specific, actionable prompts
- Include context and examples where helpful
- Test prompts with target AI systems
- Document successful prompt patterns
- Version control custom instructions

## Security Considerations
- Never include sensitive information in scripts
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper permission checks
- Validate user inputs in interactive scripts
- Follow security best practices for each language/platform

## Contribution Standards
- Test all code before committing
- Update relevant documentation
- Follow existing directory structure
- Include proper attribution for external code
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
